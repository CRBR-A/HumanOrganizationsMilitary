| --- | --- |
| Disputes - international: | Kosovo and Macedonia completed demarcation of their boundary in September 2008; Greece continues to reject the use of the name Macedonia or Republic of Macedonia |

| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | note: 478,416 estimated refugee and migrant arrivals (January 2015 - November 2017); Macedonia is predominantly a transit country and hosts fewer than 50 refugees and asylum seekers as of September 2017 |
| Illicit drugs: | major transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and hashish; minor transit point for South American cocaine destined for Europe; although not a financial center and most criminal activity is thought to be domestic, money laundering is a problem due to a mostly cash-based economy and weak enforcement |
