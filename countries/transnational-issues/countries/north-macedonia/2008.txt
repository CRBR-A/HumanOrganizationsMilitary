| Transnational Issues | Macedonia |
| --- | --- |
| Disputes - international: | Kosovo and Macedonia completed demarcation of their boundary in September 2008; Greece continues to reject the use of the name Macedonia or Republic of Macedonia |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: fewer than 1,000 (ethnic conflict in 2001) (2007) |
| Illicit drugs: | major transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and hashish; minor transit point for South American cocaine destined for Europe; although not a financial center and most criminal activity is thought to be domestic, money laundering is a problem due to a mostly cash-based economy and weak enforcement |
