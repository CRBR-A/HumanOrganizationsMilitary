| Transnational Issues | Macedonia |
| --- | --- |
| Disputes - international: | ethnic Albanians in Kosovo object to demarcation of the boundary with Macedonia in accordance with the 2000 Macedonia-Serbia and Montenegro delimitation agreement; Greece continues to reject the use of the name Macedonia or Republic of Macedonia |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: 2,678 (ethnic conflict in 2001; most IDPs have returned) (2004) |
| Illicit drugs: | major transshipment point for Southwest Asian heroin and hashish; minor transit point for South American cocaine destined for Europe; although most criminal activity is thought to be domestic and not a financial center, money laundering is a problem due to a mostly cash-based economy and weak enforcement (no arrests or prosecutions for money laundering to date) |
