| Disputes - international: | Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro have delimited most of their boundary, but sections along the Drina River remain in dispute; discussions continue with Croatia on problem sections around Kostajnica on the Una River and villages at the base of Mount Pljesevica |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: 327,200 (Bosnian Croats, Serbs, and Muslims displaced in 1992-1995 war) (2004) |
| Illicit drugs: | minor transit point for marijuana and opiate trafficking routes to Western Europe; remains highly vulnerable to money laundering activity given a primarily cash-based and unregulated economy, weak law enforcement and instances of corruption |
