| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 2 - the Government of Mali does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government acknowledged that human trafficking is a problem in Mali, but it did not demonstrate significant efforts to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders; Mali was not placed on Tier 3 because the government has a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is devoting sufficient resources to implement that plan (2012) |
