| Trafficking in persons: | current situation: Qatar is a destination country for men and women subjected to forced labor and, to a much lesser extent, forced prostitution; men and women from Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Ethiopia, Sudan, Thailand, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and China voluntarily migrate to Qatar as low-skilled laborers and domestic servants, but some subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude as domestic workers and laborers, and, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual exploitation |
| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Qatar does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; it did not demonstrate evidence of significant efforts to punish traffickers or proactively identify victims; however, the government has a written plan that, if implemented, would largely bring the country into compliance with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; it is devoting sufficient resources to implementing the plan (2011) |
