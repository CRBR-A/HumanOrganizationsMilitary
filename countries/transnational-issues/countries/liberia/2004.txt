| --- | --- |
| Disputes - international: | domestic fighting among disparate rebel groups, warlords, and youth gangs in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have created insurgencies, street violence, looting, arms trafficking, and ethnic conflicts and refugees in border areas; the Cote d'Ivoire Government accuses Liberia of supporting Ivorian rebels |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | refugees (country of origin): 13,941 (Sierra Leone), 38,325 (Cote d'Ivoire) |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: 500,000 (civil war from 1990-2004; IDP resettlement began in November 2004) (2004) |
| Illicit drugs: | transshipment point for Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin and South American cocaine for the European and US markets; corruption, criminal activity, arms-dealing, and diamond trade provide significant potential for money laundering, but the lack of well-developed financial system limits the country's utility as a major money-laundering center |
