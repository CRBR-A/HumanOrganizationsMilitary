| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | refugees (country of origin): 54,011 (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2015) |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: 79,200 (the majority are ethnic Tutsi displaced by inter-communal violence that broke out after the 1993 coup and fighting between government forces and rebel groups; no new displacements since 2008 when the last rebel group laid down its arms) (2015) |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | stateless persons: 1,302 (2014) |
| Trafficking in persons: | current situation: Burundi is a source country for children and possibly women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; business people recruit Burundian girls for prostitution domestically, as well as in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and the Middle East, and recruit boys and girls for forced labor in Burundi and Tanzania; children and young adults are coerced into forced labor in farming, mining, construction, informal commerce, or fishing; some family members, friends, and neighbors are complicit in exploiting children, luring them in with offers of educational or job opportunities |
| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List &ndash; Burundi does not comply fully with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government has a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute a significant effort toward meeting the minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking; in 2013, the government established a national coordinating body to oversee anti-trafficking efforts, completed a national action plan, and worked to finalize anti-trafficking legislation; law enforcement efforts remained modest, and investigations focused on transnational trafficking; most victim assistance continued to be provided by NGOs without government support; a system for identifying victims among vulnerable populations and referring victims to care providers was not finalized (2014) |
