| Trafficking in persons: | current situation: Guinea-Bissau is a country of origin and destination for children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; the scope of the problem of trafficking women or men for forced labor or forced prostitution is unknown; boys reportedly were transported to southern Senegal for forced manual and agricultural labor; girls may be subjected to forced domestic service and child prostitution in Senegal and Guinea; both boys and girls are forced to work as street vendors in cities in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal |
| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the government of Guinea-Bissau does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government acknowledged human trafficking is a problem and enacted a comprehensive anti-trafficking law in June 2011, followed by a national plan of action for implementing the law; the government facilitated the repatriation of 120 trafficking victims from Senegal and gave a small amount of funding to NGO shelters that provided victim care but did not pursue criminal action against trafficking offenders during the year (2012) |
| Illicit drugs: | increasingly important transit country for South American cocaine en route to Europe; enabling environment for trafficker operations thanks to pervasive corruption; archipelago-like geography around the capital facilitates drug smuggling |
