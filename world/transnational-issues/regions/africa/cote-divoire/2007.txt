| --- | --- |
| Disputes - international: | despite the presence of over 9,000 UN forces (UNOCI) in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict there has displaced hundreds of thousands of Ivorians in and out of the country as well as driven out migrants from neighboring states who worked in Ivorian cocoa plantations; Ivorian rebels reportedly hide along the borders of neighboring states |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | refugees (country of origin): 39,919 (Liberia) |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: 750,000 (2002 coup; most IDPs are in western regions) (2006) |
| Illicit drugs: | illicit producer of cannabis, mostly for local consumption; utility as a narcotic transshipment point to Europe reduced by ongoing political instability; while rampant corruption and inadequate supervision leave the banking system vulnerable to money laundering, the lack of a developed financial system limits the country's utility as a major money-laundering center |
