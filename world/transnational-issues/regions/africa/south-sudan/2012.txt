| Trafficking in persons: | current situation: South Sudan is a source and destination country for men, women, and children who are subjected to forced labor and sextrafficking; South Sudanese women and girls, particularly those who are internally displaced from rural areas, are vulnerable to forced labor and sexual exploitation in urban centers; the rising number of street children and child laborers are also exploited for forced labor and prostitution; women and girls from Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Congo are trafficked to South Sudan with promises of legitimate jobs and are forced into the sex trade; inter-ethnic abductions continue between some communities in South Sudan |
| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the government of South Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; the government continued to take some steps to eliminate the use of child soldiers in its armed forces, but it did not demonstrate evidence of increasing efforts to address other forms of trafficking; pulbic officials' awareness of human trafficking remained extremely low and the government lacked sufficient human and physical capital to adequately enforce its laws, the government indisriminately arrested individuals in prostitution, including child sex trrafficking victims, and sentenced them to prison (2012) |
