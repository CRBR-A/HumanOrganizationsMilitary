| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 3 - Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; while the government took some initial steps to acknowledge the existence of trafficking, draft anti-trafficking legislation, prosecute suspected traffickers, demobilize and reintegrate child soldiers, and waive overstay fines for foreign domestic workers, its efforts to combat human trafficking through law enforcement, protection, or prevention measures were undertaken in an ad hoc fashion, rather than as the result of strategic planning; the government convicted three traffickers, but did not officially identify trafficking victims or make public data regarding its efforts to combat human trafficking; its proxy militias reportedly unlawfully recruited and used child soldiers during the reporting period, and it did not take action to conclude a propsed action plan with the UN to address the problem (2012) |
