| Transnational Issues | BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA |
| --- | --- |
| Disputes - international: | Serbia delimited about half of the boundary with Bosnia and Herzegovina, but sections along the Drina River remain in dispute |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | refugees (country of origin): 6,703 (Croatia) (2014) |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | IDPs: 100,400 (Bosnian Croats, Serbs, and Bosniaks displaced by inter-ethnic violence, human rights violations, and armed conflict during the 1992-1995 war) (2014) |
| Refugees and internally displaced persons: | stateless persons: 101 (2014) |
| Trafficking in persons: | current situation: Bosnia and Herzegovina is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children (including the developmentally disabled) subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor; Bosnian women and girls are sexually exploited domestically; Roma children are forced to beg and to marry by local organized crime groups; Bosnians are also trafficked to other European countries |
| Trafficking in persons: | tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List &ndash; Bosnia and Herzegovina does not comply fully with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; some progress was made in 2013 in prosecuting and convicting trafficking offenders, but authorities significantly decreased their identification of victims; the national referral mechanism did not involve labor inspectors, hampering efforts to identify forced labor victims; the government has not amended all sub-national laws to criminalize all forms of trafficking consistent with national and international law (2014) |
| Illicit drugs: | increasingly a transit point for heroin being trafficked to Western Europe; minor transit point for marijuana; remains highly vulnerable to money-laundering activity given a primarily cash-based and unregulated economy, weak law enforcement, and instances of corruption |
